Q: "Is this guaranteed?"
A: "Trenches uses targeted settlements based on project marketing funds and your participation. The 1.5x is the target, not a guarantee. Here's how it works: [link]"

Q: "Can I lose money?"
A: "Your deposit buys project tokens. Token value can fluctuate. The 1.5x reward comes from project marketing funds, not token appreciation. Full details: [link]"

Q: "Why do I need to deposit?"
A: "Your deposit is your entry ticket — it buys the project's token and shows you're a real supporter, not a bot. This 'skin in the game' is what makes the system work."
