### The Opportunity

**The $50B Crypto Marketing Problem**

Crypto projects spent $50B+ in 2025 on user acquisition. The result?
- 90% of airdrop recipients sell within 24 hours
- Exchange listing fees: $200K–$2M with zero community retention
- Influencer marketing: Temporary buzz, no lasting holders

**The market is desperate for a better distribution model.**

---

### The Solution: Trenches

**Belief Coordination Infrastructure**

Trenches is the first platform to **coordinate attention into sustainable community ownership**.

Instead of extracting value through exchanges and middlemen, we align incentives:
- **Users** perform verifiable activities → earn targeted settlements
- **Projects** acquire real holders → sustainable price appreciation
- **Trenches** captures a percentage → recurring revenue

---

### The Business Model

**Revenue Streams:**

1. **Trench Deployment Fee** — 5% of project reserve
2. **Settlement Processing** — 1% of distributed volume
3. **Premium Tiers** — Priority queue access for users
4. **Analytics & API** — Institutional-grade data access

**Unit Economics:**
- Average Trench Size: $500K reserve
- Trenches per Month (Year 1): 20 → 50 → 100
- Gross Margin: 85%
- Customer Acquisition Cost: Near zero (viral mechanics)

# 🚀 VERSION 2: USER PITCH

## Target: Crypto-curious individuals, airdrop hunters, side-hustlers
## Voice: Accessible Institutional + Lifestyle
## Goal: User acquisition, waitlist conversion

---

### The Headline

**Turn Your Scroll Time Into Real Money**

*The easiest way to earn in crypto — no trading, no guessing, just participate and get paid.*

---

### The Hook

**What if your daily TikTok habit could make you $500?**

Not by selling anything.  
Not by recruiting friends.  
Just by doing what you already do: scrolling, liking, sharing.

That's Trenches.

---

### The Story (Relatable)

**Meet Sarah.**

She bought a $400 Solana phone last year. Didn't think much of it.

Last month, she checked her wallet: **$10,000 airdrop.** Just for being an early user.

Her iPhone? Gave her zero.  
Her Samsung? Zero.  
Her $400 crypto phone? **$10,000.**

That's the power of crypto airdrops. Projects pay you to use their stuff.

**The problem?** Most airdrops are random. You might get $10K. You might get $0. You never know.

---

### The Solution

**Trenches Makes It Simple**

We work with crypto projects that want to pay users like you.

Instead of random luck, you get a **structured path to earnings**:

1. **Buy** the project's tokens (your "entry ticket")
2. **Engage** — clip their videos, share their posts, join their Discord
3. **Earn** — receive targeted rewards based on your participation

**Target: Turn $1,000 into $1,500 in as little as 24 hours.**

---

### How It Works (Simple)

**The Three Trenches:**

| Trench | Time | What You Do | Target Result |
|--------|------|-------------|---------------|
| **RAPID** ⚡ | 24 hours | Post, share, engage for one day | $1,000 → $1,500 |
| **MID** 🛡️ | 7 days | Weekly tasks, community participation | $10,000 → $15,000 |
| **DEEP** 🏛️ | 30 days | Deep community involvement | $100,000 → $150,000 |

**Your activities:**
- ✅ Clip a YouTube video to your TikTok
- ✅ Retweet a project announcement
- ✅ Comment on their Discord
- ✅ Share to your WhatsApp status

**Stuff you already do. Now you get paid for it.**

---

### Why This Works

**Projects have massive marketing budgets.**

Instead of paying Facebook or Google, they pay **you**.

- Traditional ad: $5 per click, no guarantee anyone cares
- Trenches user: Real engagement, real community, **you keep the value**

**The money comes from their marketing fund.** You're just getting your fair share.

---

### The Difference

**Other Airdrops:**
- ❌ Random — might get $10K, might get $0
- ❌ Uncertain — no idea if you'll qualify
- ❌ Complicated — 47 tasks, confusing rules

**Trenches:**
- ✅ **Structured** — Clear path, clear timeline
- ✅ **Targeted** — Know exactly what you'll receive
- ✅ **Simple** — Buy, engage, earn. Three steps.

**Your rewards are structured and locked in.** The project has already deposited the tokens. You just need to complete your activities.

---

### Boost Your Earnings

**Two ways to maximize your rewards:**

1. **Boost Points** — Complete tasks faster, earn points to accelerate your timeline
2. **Belief Score** — The more you participate across the platform, the higher your priority for future trenches

**Early participants get the best positions.**

---

### Real Talk

**"Is this too good to be true?"**

We get it. Here's the reality:

- You're **buying tokens**, not giving money away
- You're **providing real marketing value** (content, engagement)
- Projects **already set aside** these rewards for users
- It's **structured**, not random luck

This isn't "free money." It's **getting paid for your attention** — something you give away for free every day.

**The only difference? Now you get compensated.**

---

### Get Started (Low Risk)

**Minimum entry: $5**

Start small. Learn the system. Scale up when you're comfortable.

**Most users start with the RAPID trench:**
- 24 hours
- $1,000 max
- Simple social tasks
- Target: $1,500 back

**Then scale to MID and DEEP as you build confidence.**

### Quick FAQ

**Q: Do I need to know crypto?**  
A: No. If you can use TikTok and Discord, you can do this.

**Q: What if I don't want to do the tasks?**  
A: You keep the tokens you bought. But you need to complete tasks for the additional rewards.

**Q: How is this different from trading?**  
A: No guessing. No charts. No "hodling and hoping." Structured participation, targeted rewards.
