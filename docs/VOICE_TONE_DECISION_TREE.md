### SCENARIO 2: Explaining the Deposit

| Channel | Voice | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Technical Docs** | INSTITUTIONAL ELITE | "User deposits are exchanged for project tokens at market rate via decentralized liquidity pools. The acquired tokens represent the user's community stake." |
| **FAQ / Help Center** | ACCESSIBLE INSTITUTIONAL | "Your deposit buys the project's token. Think of it as your entry ticket into their community." |
