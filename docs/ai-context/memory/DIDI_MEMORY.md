## 💡 NOTES & DECISIONS

### Decisions Made
1. **Launch video style:** Institutional Elite visual + accessible voice
2. **First 5 flyers:** Launch announcement, earnings showcase, how it works, belief score, trenches comparison
3. **Avatar generation:** Starting with Midjourney for visuals, ElevenLabs for voices

### Open Questions
1. Should launch video use original audio or licensed music?
2. What's the exact waitlist URL for CTAs?
3. Do we have existing screen recordings of the platform?

### Ideas Bank
- **Viral hook for Tyler:** "I spent 3 days reading the docs so you don't have to"
- **Flyer concept:** Split-screen "Before/After" Belief Score visualization
- **Template idea:** Modular design system for quick flyer generation
