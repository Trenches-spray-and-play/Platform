# Non-Negotiables

> **Status**: LAW
> 
> **Purpose**: These rules cannot be violated. Any system design that violates these must be rejected.

## Core Principles

- **Trenches never holds funds**
- **No pooled assets**
- **All payments are wallet-to-wallet**
- **No guaranteed payouts**
- **All ROI is capped and time-bound**
- **Belief must continue or payouts stop**
- **UI must expose risk clearly**
- **The app coordinates; it does not promise**

## Universal Design Standards

- **Logo & Identity**: The platform logo and primary icons must always share the same scale as the regular body/secondary text (1.25rem / 20px) to maintain a balanced, institutional aesthetic.

## Enforcement

BMAD: Treat `non_negotiables.md` as law.
Any system violating it must be rejected.

This prevents dangerous drift.
