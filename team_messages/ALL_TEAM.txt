🚀 Platform Redesign: "3 Trenches" Model Approved

Team,

Exciting update: We're redesigning the core Trenches platform from "many campaigns" to "3 perpetual trenches."

Why This Change?

Old Model:
- 20+ individual campaigns
- Each campaign starts and ends
- One project per campaign
- Complex user experience

New Model:
- Just 3 trenches (Rapid, Mid, Deep)
- Trenches never end (perpetual)
- Multiple projects per trench
- Simple, clean UX

What This Means:

For Users:
- Easier choice: Pick from 3 options, not 20+
- Better returns: Reserve grows over time
- Diversified: Exposure to multiple projects
- Safer: Dollar-pegged payouts with insurance

For Projects:
- Join existing trenches (no setup)
- Benefit from combined liquidity
- Automatic price support (buy pressure)
- Flexible: Can join multiple trenches

For Platform:
- Simpler operations
- Network effects (more users → more projects → more users)
- Sustainable flywheel economics

Key Features:

1. 3 Trenches Only:
   ⚡ Rapid (1-3 days)
   ◆ Mid (7-14 days)
   ▲ Deep (30-60 days)

2. Growing Reserves:
   - User sprays USD → Platform buys tokens
   - Token price rises → Reserve value grows
   - Users paid in appreciating tokens

3. Insurance Protection:
   - 10% insurance buffer per trench
   - Platform covers token price drops
   - Users protected from losses

Timeline:

- Week 1-2: Backend development
- Week 3: Frontend integration
- Week 4: Testing
- Week 5: Launch 🚀
