🚀 APPROVED: Begin Backend Implementation - 3 Trenches Model

Hey Lead Dev,

Great news: TBO has approved the 3 Trenches business model with specifications. You can begin backend implementation immediately.

What's Approved:
✅ 3 perpetual trenches (Rapid, Mid, Deep)
✅ Insurance buffer mechanism (10%)
✅ Reserve thresholds (20% warning, 10% pause, 5% emergency)
✅ 0.5% deposit fee structure
✅ Proportional token allocation
✅ New API: GET /api/trenches/v2

Critical Implementation Notes:

1. Insurance Buffer (REQUIRED)
   - Each trench keeps 10% insurance buffer
   - Covers token price drops
   - Platform takes loss, not users
   - Triggers: <20% warning, <10% pause sprays, <5% emergency

2. Fee Structure
   - 0.5% taken from every spray
   - Example: $1,000 spray = $5 fee, $995 effective

3. Token Allocation Formula
   Project Share = (Project Reserve / Total Trench Reserve) × Spray Amount
