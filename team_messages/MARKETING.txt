🎨 New Messaging: "3 Trenches. Infinite Projects."

Hey Marketing Lead,

Big change: We're rebranding from "many campaigns" to "3 perpetual trenches." This is a fundamental shift in how we present the platform.

The New Narrative:

OLD: "Browse 20+ campaigns"
NEW: "Three Trenches. Infinite Projects."

What Changed:

Before | After
-------|------
Individual campaigns | 3 perpetual trenches
Campaigns start/end | Trenches never end
One project = one campaign | Multiple projects per trench
Static returns | Growing reserve flywheel

Key Messaging Pillars:

1. Simplicity:
- "Just 3 trenches to choose from"
- "Rapid (1-3 days), Mid (7-14 days), Deep (30-60 days)"
- "No more decision fatigue"

2. Perpetual Growth:
- "Trenches that never end"
- "Reserve grows with every spray"
- "Compound benefits over time"

3. Multi-Project Exposure:
- "One trench, many projects"
- "Diversified token exposure"
- "Featured projects rotate"

4. Dollar-Pegged Safety:
- "Guaranteed USD returns"
- "Paid in appreciating tokens"
- "Insurance-backed payouts"

New Homepage Copy (Approved):

Headline: "Three Trenches. Infinite Projects."

Subheadline: "Deposit into perpetual trenches. Earn boosted yields from multiple projects. The fairer way to coordinate liquidity."

How It Works (4 steps):
1. Projects Add Reserve - Tokens enter the trench
2. You Spray Capital - USD powers the flywheel
3. Reserve Grows - Buying pressure raises token prices
4. Cycle Repeats - Compound growth for everyone

Visual Changes:

Homepage:
- 3 large trench cards (not a grid of 20+)
- Each card shows multiple token badges [HYPE][SOL][BLT]
- Reserve composition bar (visual)
- Risk indicators (🟢🟡🔴)

Trench Cards:
- Show combined reserve value ($2.5M+)
- Featured project logos
- "+N more" indicator
- APY and duration

Materials to Update:
- [ ] Website homepage copy
- [ ] Pitch deck (investor & user versions)
- [ ] Social media messaging
- [ ] Email campaigns
- [ ] Help center articles
- [ ] SEO metadata

Competitive Positioning:

vs. Traditional Launchpads:
"They have campaigns that end. We have trenches that grow."

vs. Yield Farms:
"They pay in one token. We pay in a diversified mix."

vs. Staking:
"They have fixed yields. We have appreciating reserves."
