## Core Beliefs

| # | Belief | Why It Matters |
|---|--------|----------------|
| 1 | **Belief must continue after you — or you lose** | System collapses without sustained participation |
| 2 | **No custody, no pooling, no guarantees** | Legal clarity, trust preservation |
| 3 | **Attention is work** | Social proof earns priority, not money |
| 4 | **Contribution > capital** | Belief scores affect access, not just entry size |
| 5 | **Humans > bots** | Social verification creates friction |
| 6 | **Everything must be observable** | Queue, payouts, caps — all visible |
| 7 | **Upside is capped, loss is real** | No infinite gains, explicit risk |

## Derived from: [non_negotiables.md](file:///Users/mac/Trenches%20-%20Spray%20and%20Pray/docs/non_negotiables.md)

- Trenches never holds funds
- No pooled assets
- All payments are wallet-to-wallet
- No guaranteed payouts
- All ROI is capped and time-bound
- UI must expose risk clearly
- The app coordinates; it does not promise

## Enforcement

Every feature, every line of code must pass:

> **Does this violate a belief?**

If yes → reject it.
If unclear → escalate before building.
